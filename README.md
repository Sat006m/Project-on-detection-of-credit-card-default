n this project, I have used the data on 30,000 people with 25 features.Here first, I performed features engineering, which
also includes standardization. Since default detection is a classification problem, I have used several predictive models such
as random forest, logistic regression, SVM and Neural network. Among these models neural network and random forest
shows best accuracy and logistic regression is not far behind.
